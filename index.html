            <p>If there is no final place for civil disobedience, then the government has been made autonomous, and as such, it has been put in the place of the living God.  And that point is exactly when the early Christians performed their acts of civil disobedience, even when it cost them their lives. ...Acts of State which contradict God's Law are illegitmate and acts of tyranny.  Tyranny is ruling without the sanction of God.  To resist tyranny is to honour God. ...The bottom line is that at a certain point there is not only the right, but the duty to disobey the State.<br>
